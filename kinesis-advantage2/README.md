## Writing changes to the keyboard

TODO

## Cheatsheet

* Enabling/disabling the V-drive: `progrm + F1`
* Choosing a layout: `progrm + <layout letter>`
* Never ever use `progrm + F3-F7`! These are designed to fuck everything up and will make you go crazy reconfiguring everything.
* Toggling Power User Mode: `progm + shift + esc`. I want it on. It should already be on.

## My layouts

* `m`: Mac layout for work.
* `w`: Windows layout for work.
* `g`: Gaming layout for both Mac and Windows.
